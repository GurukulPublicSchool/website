                                    been endowed with the responsibility of heading one of the premier educational
                                    institutions of the country. I am proud to be bestowed with the mantle of Principal
                                    and
                                    I invoke God's blessing in making this institution a greater one with all his
                                    graces.
                                    With the support of the Gurukul Public School Staff, the Old Boys Association, the
                                    state
                                    authorities and the wishes of the well wishers, I am sure this school will reach its

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Godavari House has a glorious
                        history
                        . The House is named&nbsp; after the largest river of southern India, ‘Godavari’.&nbsp; It
                        covers a
                        length of about 1465 kms, originates from the Western Ghats of Maharastra, behind the village
                        Trimbak in Nashik district before submerging in the Bay of Bengal.Being the largest river of
                        Deccan
                        and life- lines for millions, its gigantic size, fertile delta and its holiness&nbsp; become a
                        source of inspiration for the Great Godavarians. The achievements and success of the cadets
                        really
                        signify the name ‘Dakshin Ganga’ in true sense of the term.Godavari House has reached at the
                        pinnacle of success since its coming into being in 1962. The House has proved its worth not only
                        in
                        academics but also in games, co-curricular activities and other inter- house competitions . The
                        House did hatrick in capturing the most coveted ‘Cock House’ trophy since the session 2008-09.
                        This
                        House has been declared as the champion House in the Annual Athletic meets for the last three
                        consecutive years. This is the largest House in area amongst the ten Houses and also has started
                        the
                        House library first in Gurukul Public School, BBSR. Godavari House is the first House to have
                        the colour
                        television in the year 1986. It seems that the cadets have been very much influenced by the
                        indian
                        culture which has always been reflected in their performance in the inter-house cultural
                        competitions and they have been adjudged as the best thrice in succession.The present shape and
                        success of the House would not have been possible without the blood and sweat of the past house
                        masters. Here it is worth- mentioning that the housemaster like late N.P Dixit (1974), Master
                        (Chem.) has contributed a lot in upbringing the House.In&nbsp; the past many cadets participated
                        in
                        various events outside the school and with their excellent performance they brought laurels to
                        the
                        House. Many of the boys excelled in every walk of life and now they are the role -models for the
                        young Godavarians.The most illustrious alumnus of the Godavari House is (Retd) Lt. Gen. J. K.
                        Mohanty VYSM,SM,VSM ,ADC school no- 16, who joined NDA in 1966, and became an indispensable
                        member
                        of the Indian Army. He donated Rs 7 lakhs for the renovation of the House and since then this
                        House
                        became a model House for others. This shows his love and respect for the House, where his
                        success
                        was nourished right from his studentship.Godavari House is very hopeful to witness improvement
                        being
                        successful in the coming years and will touch the new height of accomplishment and excellence in
                        every field.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mahanadi House has been
                        named
                        after the longest river of Odisha – Mahanadi.&nbsp; The river Mahanadi has its source in the
                        highlands of the Raipur district of Chhattisgarh and proceeds through the state of Odisha to
                        reach
                        the Bay of Bengal. It has bestowed the people a total of 80000 sq kms of cultivable land which
                        is
                        almost 4% of the total cultivable land in India. Today the agriculture of the state primarily
                        depends on a network of canals that arise from the river Mahanadi. The immense contribution of
                        the
                        river to the economy of the state is known to one and all.<br />
                        Justifying its name, Mahanadi House has been contributing immensely to the society by producing
                        true
                        and loyal citizens of the country since its inception in 1964. Although we are not sure who the
                        1st
                        housemaster of Mahanadi was, yet but Mr. B N L Srivastav, who was also the Sr. Master and now
                        retired was the house master from 1970 to 1982. During this period the name of the House was
                        changed
                        for some reason which is not known exactly and was called Ganga House till 1996. In 1996, the
                        House
                        got back its original name and since then it is being known as Mahanadi House. The House has
                        produced many illustrious persons. Some of them are Lt Gen KPD Samant, Air Marshal J N Burma,
                        Mr.
                        Pritish Basa (present President of OBA), Mr. R K Tripathy IAS, Brig L C Pattanaik, Mr Nikunja
                        Sundarray, IAS. Mr R R Mishra, Mr Abani Mishra, Mr Amresh Routaray, Mr H Mohapatra, Mr Tushar
                        Mishra, Dr Sushil Das were the inmates of this House who are well-known in their own fields.The
                        Mahanadians are more popularly called as Mammoths of Mahanadi, who are very good at sports &amp;
                        games. This House was the most influential over boxing &amp; Athletics events for quite a long
                        time.
                        Every cadet of Mahanadi epitomizes himself with everlasting traditional virtues of self
                        discipline
                        and loyalty. The cadets of Mahanadi take pride in calling themselves as Mammoths of Mahanadi and
                        never fall back in taking the challenges of real life. The motto of the House ‘Can Do It’ is
                        always
                        reflected in their activities. May God bless the Mahanadians with success and glory.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the Houses of
                        GURUKUL PUBLIC SCHOOL, Chandikhol, Jajpur are named after the major rivers of our country. The
                        House derives its name from
                        one of the important rivers of the western part ,that is river Narmada. River Narmada originates
                        from Amarkantak hills in Madhya Pradesh and flows towards the western direction crossing Madhya
                        Pradesh, Maharastra &amp; Gujarat. Finally, it enters into the Arabian Sea. It covers a distance
                        of
                        1312 kms. As the rivers serve the people in all ages, our cadets learn to serve the country and
                        its
                        people.. The only motive of the School is to motivate the cadets to join NDA, Khadagwasla and
                        get
                        commissioned as officers, who would then contribute towards the security and defence of the
                        country.
                        Narmada House started functioning in the year 1962 and Mr. R C Ram was the first house-master of
                        the
                        House and Manoj Marandi was the first house captain. In the beginning it was a senior House and
                        later on it got converted into a junior House and since last two years it has become a fresher’s
                        House where innocent cadets are moulded to perform various activities in their life. Well
                        supported
                        by the efficient and dedicated staff – members the House takes special care of its cadets
                        teaching
                        them the good qualities like honesty, co-operation, fellow-feeling, self-reliance, confidence
                        and
                        the other values. This House has produced a good number of great and successful personalities in
                        the
                        fields of Armed Forces and Civil Services like Shri Dinkar Sharma, school no- 396 who is at
                        present
                        a Shankaracharya in Bandipura Peeth, Mr. R. P Swain, the former Sports Minister of the
                        Government of
                        Orissa. For a decade since its inception this House became the champion in hockey and
                        basketball. In
                        gardening and cleanliness House stood first consecutively for more than three years. The House
                        will
                        always work hard to keep its name and fame. For that we expect the blessings and co-operation of
                        one
                        and all.</p>

                        House
                        is a holding House named as per the great river ‘Krishna’ flowing from the western ghats in the
                        west
                        to the eastern ghats in the east to meet the sea. This House refreshes its heart every year at
                        the
                        time of new&nbsp;admission&nbsp;of the cadets into class VI and after one year overflows with
                        emotion when the inmates leave the<br />
                        House to shift to other junior Houses after the annual examination. Still in this yearly process
                        it
                        keeps memory of tiny cadets for years together. At the time of my entry into Gurukul Public
                        School,
                        Chandikhol, Jajpur as a teacher in 1987 I was attracted to enjoy the natural group activities of
                        these
                        class VI cadets and smile on their innocent faces . I was also keen to watch their exhibition
                        match
                        among themselves , clapping during senior cadet’s match, watching the cultural show, dancing on
                        the
                        occasion of New Year Eve etc. Mr. L.N Pandey was the house-master of Krishna at that time and
                        then
                        Mr. N S Verma took the charge. I was getting pleasure to spare my leisure time with them. One
                        day
                        our Principal Col M PS Tyagi called me to his office and told, ‘I want to give you an odd duty.’
                        To
                        reply him, without any thought I told ,’Yes sir’, not only to obey the order of the Head of my
                        institution but also to honour his impartial and affectionate personality. He detailed me to be
                        the
                        house master of Krishna House. The day was 31st January, 1992. At that time I was the youngest
                        house-master here after the completion of my probation period. More than 11 years passed in
                        Krishna,
                        then I had been given the housemastership of Godavari House by the Principal Col. D Choudhury on
                        19th sep 2002. I continued there till 28th April , 2004. Then after a gap again I became the
                        housemaster of Krishna w.e.f 1st April 2009 and continuing till now. During the tenure of my
                        housemastership&nbsp; I remember the golden era of Krishna House when Cdr M V Vasudevan was the
                        Principal. Krishna and Yamuna both the Houses were fresher’s Houses at that time. Mr.T P Rath
                        was
                        the house-master of Yamuna. We, both the house-masters had been given full freedom to decide any
                        project for these fresher’s houses without any common official attachment with the other Houses.
                        Our
                        functions, picnics and co-curricular activities were organized as per our internal decisions.
                        Both
                        the Houses were going for picnics at a time to one place even when the strength was 140. The
                        officers of the School including the staff-members attached to the houses were accompaning the
                        cadets happily. I recall the association of the hostel superintendents starting from Mr. B
                        Pattnaik,
                        Mrs N dixit and Mrs Sasmita Devi with this house. Mrs Sasmita, who passéd away on 7th Feb 2007
                        in a
                        pathetic road accident, was not only working as a matron, but also as the mother of 70 fresher
                        cadets. She was a poet and able to know the child psychology and how to deal with them in
                        different
                        situations. As the freshers were not included in the inter house routines competitions, we were
                        conducting inter-dormitory competitions like song, dance, acting, quiz, some games and sports
                        etc
                        and giving away prizes in the House Annual Day. House Annual Day cum prize giving ceremony was
                        our
                        own internal creation with the approval of the Principal. For this ceremony Headmaster,
                        Registrar,
                        School Doctor and the other staff-members were invited by the cadets.&nbsp; The small cadets
                        were
                        very happy to receive the prizes from them as this was their first exposure in this big
                        institution.
                        Like this, years and years are passing away, but the memories of Krishna House still resounds in
                        my
                        heart reflecting the golden moments of the past. It might not create a history, but can keep a
                        page
                        of memory with a hope of golden future.</div>

                        named after the river Yamuna, the most sacred river among all the rivers as per the Hindu
                        mythology.
                        Yamuna House cadets, with the sheer interest, grit, determination and hard work have achieved
                        the
                        glory of being the cadets of the ‘Cock House’ many times since its inception in 1962. Focussing
                        on
                        the sports arena the cadets of the House left no stone unturned in order to carve a niche for
                        themselves. To prove their mettle ’the Sporty green’ proved their worth in inter-house
                        tournaments
                        by bagging the trophies several times. Upholding the ideal of the school motto

                        and Veerta’ the House excelled in academics&nbsp; as well. Moreover, every cadet of the House
                        epitomizes himself with the everlasting traditional traits of self-discipline &amp; allegiance.
                        Mr.
                        Sudarsan Panigrahi, Master (Mathematics) was appointed as the first housemaster of Yamuna House.
                        Then after Mr HB Dash took over the House as the house-master for more than 15 years. The source
                        of
                        river Yamuna is at Yamunotri in the Himalayan Mountains. It flows through the states of Delhi,
                        Haryana &amp; Uttar Pradesh before merging with the Ganges at Allahabad. Yamuna House is
